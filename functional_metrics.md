Evaluating whether a piece of code adheres to functional programming principles can be done by examining various metrics and characteristics. Here are key metrics to consider:

### Metrics to Evaluate Functional Programming Code:

1. **Immutability**:
   - **Percentage of Immutable Data Structures**: High usage of immutable data structures (like `val` in Scala, `const` in JavaScript, or persistent data structures).
   - **Absence of Mutable State**: Minimal use of mutable state (like `var` in Scala, `let` in JavaScript, or mutable collections).

2. **Pure Functions**:
   - **Percentage of Pure Functions**: Functions that do not have side effects and return the same output given the same input.
   - **Side Effect Isolation**: Use of techniques to isolate or minimize side effects, such as the use of monads in languages like Haskell.

3. **Higher-Order Functions**:
   - **Usage of Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that take other functions as parameters or return them as results.
   - **Functional Constructs**: Use of functional programming constructs like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `flatMap`, etc.

4. **Function Composition**:
   - **Extent of Function Composition**: Combining simple functions to build more complex functions.
   - **Chaining Operations**: Use of method chaining or pipelines to process data in steps.

5. **Pattern Matching**:
   - **Use of Pattern Matching**: Leveraging pattern matching to handle data structures instead of extensive use of conditionals (if-else, switch-case).

6. **Recursion Over Iteration**:
   - **Recursion Usage**: Preference for recursion (often tail-recursive) instead of traditional loops (for, while).
   - **Tail-Call Optimization**: Use of tail-call optimization to prevent stack overflow in recursive calls.

7. **Declarative Constructs**:
   - **Declarative vs. Imperative Code**: Code written in a declarative style (what to do) rather than imperative (how to do it).

8. **Referential Transparency**:
   - **Referential Transparency**: Code where expressions can be replaced with their values without changing the program's behavior.

9. **Lazy Evaluation**:
   - **Lazy Evaluation Techniques**: Use of lazy evaluation to defer computation until necessary (e.g., lazy lists, lazy evaluation in function parameters).

10. **Error Handling**:
    - **Functional Error Handling**: Use of functional error handling constructs such as `Option`, `Either`, `Try` in Scala, or similar constructs in other languages.
